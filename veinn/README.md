# VEINN: Vector Encrypted Invertible Neural Network

VEINN is a **post-quantum cryptographic** primitive that combines:

- **Invertible Neural Networks (INNs)**  
- **Lattice-based cryptography (LWE/RLWE hardness)**  
- **Homomorphic encryption features**  

to form a **vector-space symmetric cipher** with **post-quantum security assumptions**.  

VEINN encrypts data blockwise as vectors in $\mathbb{Z}_{2^{16}}^n$, applying coupling layers, modular scalings, and shuffles derived from a seed. Optionally, **Learning With Errors (LWE)**-based pseudorandom functions (PRFs) are used in the key schedule, embedding lattice hardness. The result is a **fast, invertible, lattice-secure block cipher** that supports **homomorphic addition and multiplication**.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CaelumSculptoris/veinn.git
cd veinn
```

(Requires Python 3.8+ and `numpy`.)

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage via CLI

#### Encrypt a file
```bash
python veinn.py encrypt --infile plaintext.txt --outfile ciphertext.json --seed mysecretseed
```

#### Decrypt a file
```bash
python veinn.py decrypt --infile ciphertext.json --outfile recovered.txt --seed mysecretseed
```

#### Homomorphic addition
```bash
python veinn.py add --infile1 ciphertext1.json --infile2 ciphertext2.json --outfile sum.json
```

#### Homomorphic multiplication
```bash
python veinn.py mul --infile1 ciphertext1.json --infile2 ciphertext2.json --outfile product.json
```

## üêç Examples (Python API)

You can also use **VEINN directly from Python**:

```python
from veinn import encrypt, decrypt, homomorphic_add

# Secret seed (used to derive key + parameters)
seed = "mysecretseed"

# Messages
msg1 = b"hello world"
msg2 = b"goodbye world"

# Encrypt both
ct1 = encrypt(msg1, seed)
ct2 = encrypt(msg2, seed)

# Homomorphic addition (ciphertexts add ‚Üí plaintexts add)
ct_sum = homomorphic_add(ct1, ct2)

# Decrypt results
dec1 = decrypt(ct1, seed)
dec2 = decrypt(ct2, seed)
dec_sum = decrypt(ct_sum, seed)

print("Decrypted msg1:", dec1)
print("Decrypted msg2:", dec2)
print("Decrypted homomorphic sum:", dec_sum)
```

This produces:
```
Decrypted msg1: b'hello world'
Decrypted msg2: b'goodbye world'
Decrypted homomorphic sum: b'...'  # vector sum of plaintexts
```

## üî¨ How It Works

### Vector Encryption
- Plaintext is split into blocks, converted into vectors in $\mathbb{Z}_{2^{16}}^n$.  
- Each block passes through multiple **rounds** of:
  1. **Coupling layers** (invertible, RealNVP-style).  
  2. **Elementwise scaling** by odd vectors (invertible mod $2^{16}$).  
  3. **Shuffle permutations** for diffusion.  

### Lattice Security
- Parameters derived from seed using SHAKE or an **LWE-based PRF**.  
- LWE PRF introduces lattice-hardness assumptions (believed post-quantum secure).  

### Homomorphism
- Ciphertexts form a **vector space**:  
  - Addition of ciphertexts ‚Üí addition of plaintexts.  
  - Negacyclic convolution of ciphertexts ‚Üí multiplication of plaintexts (in ring).

## üìä Comparison

| Scheme   | Type        | PQ Secure? | Homomorphic? | Performance |
|----------|------------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| AES-128  | Block cipher | ‚ùå (Grover) | No           | High |
| RSA/ECC  | Public-key  | ‚ùå (Shor)   | No           | Medium |
| Kyber    | Lattice KEM | ‚úÖ          | Limited      | Medium |
| CKKS     | Lattice FHE | ‚úÖ          | Yes (approx) | Low |
| **VEINN** | Symmetric  | ‚úÖ (LWE)    | Yes (add/mul)| High |

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

- **Classical attacks**: Differential/linear cryptanalysis hindered by nonlinear couplings + random scalings.  
- **Quantum attacks**: Grover limited by seed size (recommend ‚â•256-bit seed). LWE PRF resists known quantum algorithms.  
- **Integrity**: HMAC ensures ciphertext authenticity.
