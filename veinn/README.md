# VEINN: Vector Encrypted Invertible Neural Network

VEINN is a **post-quantum cryptographic** primitive that combines:

- **Invertible Neural Networks (INNs)**  
- **Lattice-based cryptography (LWE/RLWE hardness)**  
- **Homomorphic encryption features**  

to form a **vector-space symmetric cipher** with **post-quantum security assumptions**.  

VEINN encrypts data blockwise as vectors in $\mathbb{Z}_{2^{16}}^n$, applying coupling layers, modular scalings, and shuffles derived from a seed. Optionally, **Learning With Errors (LWE)**-based pseudorandom functions (PRFs) are used in the key schedule, embedding lattice hardness. The result is a **fast, invertible, lattice-secure block cipher** that supports **homomorphic addition and multiplication**.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CaelumSculptoris/veinn.git
cd veinn
```

(Requires Python 3.8+ and `numpy`.)

Install dependencies:

source bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage via CLI

#### Menu access
```bash
python3 cli/veinn.py 
```

#### package access
```bash
python3 -m cli/package.cli
```

#### Encrypt a file
```bash
python veinn.py encrypt --infile plaintext.txt --outfile ciphertext.json --seed mysecretseed
```

#### Decrypt a file
```bash
python veinn.py decrypt --infile ciphertext.json --outfile recovered.txt --seed mysecretseed
```

#### Homomorphic addition
```bash
python veinn.py add --infile1 ciphertext1.json --infile2 ciphertext2.json --outfile sum.json
```

#### Homomorphic multiplication
```bash
python veinn.py mul --infile1 ciphertext1.json --infile2 ciphertext2.json --outfile product.json
```

## üêç Examples (Python API)

You can also use **VEINN directly from Python**:

```python
from veinn import encrypt, decrypt, homomorphic_add

# Secret seed (used to derive key + parameters)
seed = "mysecretseed"

# Messages
msg1 = b"hello world"
msg2 = b"goodbye world"

# Encrypt both
ct1 = encrypt(msg1, seed)
ct2 = encrypt(msg2, seed)

# Homomorphic addition (ciphertexts add ‚Üí plaintexts add)
ct_sum = homomorphic_add(ct1, ct2)

# Decrypt results
dec1 = decrypt(ct1, seed)
dec2 = decrypt(ct2, seed)
dec_sum = decrypt(ct_sum, seed)

print("Decrypted msg1:", dec1)
print("Decrypted msg2:", dec2)
print("Decrypted homomorphic sum:", dec_sum)
```

This produces:
```
Decrypted msg1: b'hello world'
Decrypted msg2: b'goodbye world'
Decrypted homomorphic sum: b'...'  # vector sum of plaintexts
```

## üî¨ How It Works

### Vector Encryption
- Plaintext is split into blocks, converted into vectors in $\mathbb{Z}_{2^{16}}^n$.  
- Each block passes through multiple **rounds** of:
  1. **Coupling layers** (invertible, RealNVP-style).  
  2. **Elementwise scaling** by odd vectors (invertible mod $2^{16}$).  
  3. **Shuffle permutations** for diffusion.  

### Lattice Security
- Parameters derived from seed using SHAKE or an **LWE-based PRF**.  
- LWE PRF introduces lattice-hardness assumptions (believed post-quantum secure).  

### Homomorphism
- Ciphertexts form a **vector space**:  
  - Addition of ciphertexts ‚Üí addition of plaintexts.  
  - Negacyclic convolution of ciphertexts ‚Üí multiplication of plaintexts (in ring).

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

- **Classical attacks**: Differential/linear cryptanalysis hindered by nonlinear couplings + random scalings.  
- **Quantum attacks**: Grover limited by seed size (recommend ‚â•256-bit seed). LWE PRF resists known quantum algorithms.  
- **Integrity**: HMAC ensures ciphertext authenticity.

## Notes
   - 25 YoE in software engineering, frontend frameworks specialist. Zero YoE Python/Cryptography. Please dont judge me too strongly, I know the code looks like garbage. Primarily trying to get a working and stable PoC before I refactor the code and abstract the VEINN primitive out as an importable class. If you'd like to help clean up some of my code, create a pull request.

### Updates
   - Food for thought: You're faced with an unconventional problem that conventional tools aren't going to solve, and any solution outside of the standard tool set is going to sound like magical thinking... but sometimes that's what it takes - a little magic. So here we are trying to solve hard problems that conventional tools can't and it all seems a bit alien.

### TODO
   - Integrate updates to command line and package.   
   - Losing \x80 when padding 16bit unsigned int to 32bit unsigned int.. so I'm trying to figure out whats going on with the padding... which is actually tangential to the fundamental premise of Lattice/INN cipher blocks and I could totally move on from the toy model... but I'm stubborn and I wanna see it work e2e as a proof.
   - SBox should be improved for true nonlinearity. Predicated on the larger dtype... i think.
