# Key-Seeded Invertible Nonlinear Vector Transforms for Post-Quantum Cryptography (KSNVT)

## Abstract
This work proposes a novel approach to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) leveraging key-seeded nonlinear invertible transforms acting on vectorized messages. By using secret keys as seeds to generate parameters of nonlinear yet exactly invertible mappings—such as affine coupling layers inspired by invertible neural networks—messages are encrypted into high-dimensional vectors. Decryption requires the secret key to exactly invert these transforms, while attackers face the complexity of inverting nonlinear mappings without a trapdoor.

The approach aims to:
- Break algebraic linearity exploited by quantum algorithms using nonlinear, high-dimensional mappings.
- Provide exact invertibility, enabling lossless decryption via the trapdoor key.
- Introduce large key spaces and parameterized transforms resistant to classical and quantum cryptanalysis.
- Lay groundwork for embedding noise/error tolerance to increase hardness, akin to lattice-based PQC.

## 1. Introduction
The rise of quantum computing threatens classical cryptographic schemes such as RSA and ECC. There is a pressing need for new cryptographic primitives resistant to quantum attacks. This proposal explores a new direction using nonlinear, invertible vector transforms keyed by secret seeds, inspired by recent advances in invertible neural networks.

## 2. Background
Invertible neural networks (INNs) provide bijective mappings with tractable inverses, useful for lossless transformations. Coupling layers, a key building block, enable efficient, exact inversion. PQC commonly relies on problems such as lattices; this work proposes a novel hardness assumption based on the complexity of inverting nonlinear, key-parameterized transforms without the secret.

## 3. Scheme Description
### 3.1 Key Generation
- The secret key \( k \) seeds a pseudo-random generator producing parameters (scale, shift) for affine coupling layers.

### 3.2 Encryption
- Vectorize the plaintext message \( ec{m} \) into a fixed-length float vector.
- Apply the affine coupling layer(s) keyed by \( k \) to produce ciphertext \( ec{c} \).

### 3.3 Decryption
- Regenerate parameters from \( k \).
- Invert the affine coupling layer(s) to recover \( ec{m} \) exactly.

## 4. Security Assumptions
- Without \( k \), inverting the nonlinear transform is hard due to high-dimensional, nonlinear mixing.
- The keyspace and parameter complexity resist brute force and Grover's algorithm speedups.
- Embedding noise and error tolerance can increase hardness analogous to Learning With Errors.

## 5. Implementation Considerations
- Fixed-length vector encoding of messages.
- Stacking multiple invertible layers for stronger mixing.
- Trade-offs between ciphertext expansion and security.

## 6. Future Work
- Formal security proofs and cryptanalysis.
- Extending to other invertible nonlinear mappings.
- Benchmarking and optimizing performance.

## 7. Conclusion
The KSNVT approach offers a promising new direction for PQC by leveraging exact invertible nonlinear transforms keyed by secret seeds, bridging cryptography and neural-inspired transformations.
