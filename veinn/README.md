# VEINN: Vector Encrypted Invertible Neural Network

VEINN is a **post-quantum cryptographic** primitive that combines:

- **Invertible Neural Networks (INNs)**  
- **Lattice-based cryptography (LWE/RLWE hardness)**  
- **Homomorphic encryption features**  

to form a **vector-space symmetric cipher** with **post-quantum security assumptions**.  

VEINN encrypts data blockwise as vectors in $\mathbb{Z}_{2^{16}}^n$, applying coupling layers, modular scalings, and shuffles derived from a seed. Optionally, **Learning With Errors (LWE)**-based pseudorandom functions (PRFs) are used in the key schedule, embedding lattice hardness. The result is a **fast, invertible, lattice-secure block cipher** that supports **homomorphic addition and multiplication**.

## üêç Examples (Python API)

You can also use **VEINN directly from Python**:

```python
from veinn import encrypt, decrypt, homomorphic_add

# Secret seed (used to derive key + parameters)
seed = "mysecretseed"

# Messages
msg1 = b"hello world"
msg2 = b"goodbye world"

# Encrypt both
ct1 = encrypt(msg1, seed)
ct2 = encrypt(msg2, seed)

# Homomorphic addition (ciphertexts add ‚Üí plaintexts add)
ct_sum = homomorphic_add(ct1, ct2)

# Decrypt results
dec1 = decrypt(ct1, seed)
dec2 = decrypt(ct2, seed)
dec_sum = decrypt(ct_sum, seed)

print("Decrypted msg1:", dec1)
print("Decrypted msg2:", dec2)
print("Decrypted homomorphic sum:", dec_sum)
```

This produces:
```
Decrypted msg1: b'hello world'
Decrypted msg2: b'goodbye world'
Decrypted homomorphic sum: b'...'  # vector sum of plaintexts
```

## üî¨ How It Works

### Vector Encryption
- Plaintext is split into blocks, converted into vectors in $\mathbb{Z}_{2^{16}}^n$.  
- Each block passes through multiple **rounds** of:
  1. **Coupling layers** (invertible, RealNVP-style).  
  2. **Elementwise scaling** by odd vectors (invertible mod $2^{16}$).  
  3. **Shuffle permutations** for diffusion.  

### Lattice Security
- Parameters derived from seed using SHAKE or an **LWE-based PRF**.  
- LWE PRF introduces lattice-hardness assumptions (believed post-quantum secure).  

### Homomorphism
- Ciphertexts form a **vector space**:  
  - Addition of ciphertexts ‚Üí addition of plaintexts.  
  - Negacyclic convolution of ciphertexts ‚Üí multiplication of plaintexts (in ring).

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

- **Classical attacks**: Differential/linear cryptanalysis hindered by nonlinear couplings + random scalings.  
- **Quantum attacks**: Grover limited by seed size (recommend ‚â•256-bit seed). LWE PRF resists known quantum algorithms.  
- **Integrity**: HMAC ensures ciphertext authenticity.

## Notes
   - Baked in Fujisaki-Okamoto transforms to abstract Kyber out requires more time, will revist. Refactor and clean up now prioritized.

### Vector Space Notes
   - Treat one partition of the INN state as a basis (row/column vector), and embed the plaintext via dot products into that Vector space.
   - This makes decryption equivalent to projecting back out of a high-dimensional functional space without knowing the basis.
   - Hardness aspect: this ties plaintext recovery to solving an inverse functional decomposition problem in vector space, which is infeasible without the right partition (key).
   - Analogy: it‚Äôs like ‚Äúhiding‚Äù the message inside a random orthogonal projection ‚Äî but the projection is entangled with the secret INN state.
   - r and s are functionally the left and right basis elements. Together they map plaintext coefficients into a bilinear product (a rank-1-ish embedding if r and s were rank-1 operators; with full polynomials they act as dense operators).
   - The core hardness intuition: an attacker seeing only c = r ‚ãÜ m ‚ãÜ s + e must recover m without knowing r/s ‚Äî this is akin to solving for m from bilinear measurements, which is hard if r and s are unknown, random, and invertible (especially with added noise).
   - Considerably harder, considerably slower.

### Updates   
   - Added experimental "Hilbert" space coupling functions to project plaintext into vectorspace. Currently commented out during testing. Probably will deprecate. Currently ring_convolution/RLWE is like a sigma function. In ring convolution the structure is circulant / Toeplitz and the NTT makes it diagonal, whereas projecting the plaintext into vector space is closer to tensor product structure.
   - Kyber abstraction... You know what I'm going to leave this as an exercise for the reader to implement.

### TODO
   - Integrate updates to command line and package.   
   - Considering swaping ISO 7816 for OAEP.
   - Remove unused functions in veinn.py.
   - Wrapper for Keygen/Encaps/Decaps allowing easy swaping of Kyber/FO
